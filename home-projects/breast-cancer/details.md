# RSNA Breast Cancer Detection

Breast cancer is a significant cause of cancer-related fatalities among women globally. Timely detection of breast cancer is critical for successful treatment and improved survival rates. In recent times, deep learning techniques have emerged as promising tools for detecting breast cancer from medical images, including mammograms.

## Project Overview

The RSNA Breast Cancer Detection competition, hosted on Kaggle, serves as an important initiative to foster the development of machine learning models for breast cancer detection. Participants are provided with a dataset of mammogram images, accompanied by labels indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer. The primary challenge is to create deep learning models capable of accurately detecting breast cancer from these mammogram images.

In this project, we explore the RSNA Breast Cancer Detection competition, examining the approaches and techniques employed by top-performing models. Our objective is to gain valuable insights into the best practices for utilizing deep learning methods in breast cancer detection and understand the advancements made in this critical field.

## Key Features

- Deep learning models for mammogram analysis
