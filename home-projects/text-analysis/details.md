# Contradictory Text Analysis NLP

We are conducting a classification task on pairs of sentences, which consist of a premise and a hypothesis. The task involves categorizing each pair into one of three categories - entailment, contradiction, or neutral.

## Example Analysis

Using the premise: "He came, he opened the door and I remember looking back and seeing the expression on his face, and I could tell that he was disappointed."

- **Entailment example:** "Just by the look on his face when he came through the door I just knew that he was let down" - This is true based on the premise information.
- **Neutral example:** "He was trying not to make us feel guilty but we knew we had caused him trouble" - Cannot be concluded from the premise.
- **Contradiction example:** "He was so excited and bursting with joy that he practically knocked the door off its frame" - This contradicts the premise information.

## Technical Features

- Natural Language Processing with BERT-based models
- Multi-class text classification (entailment, contradiction, neutral)
- Multilingual support for 15 languages
- Advanced text preprocessing and tokenization
- Performance evaluation and model optimization

## Dataset

The dataset contains premise-hypothesis pairs in fifteen different languages, namely Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, German, Greek, English, Spanish, French, Hindi, Russian, Swahili, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, and Vietnamese. This project focuses primarily on English pairs but demonstrates the multilingual capabilities of modern NLP models.
