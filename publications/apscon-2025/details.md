## Abstract

This paper presents a novel anomaly detection algorithm that improves the accuracy of step detection by eliminating false detections caused by signals that mimic walking, such as hand movements, vibrations, dropping the phone, rapid movements, and actions such as standing up or sitting down, which can affect reliability. Numerous anomalous movements can mimic walking, making it difficult to identify and rule them all out. This challenge underscores the need for robust anomaly detection methods that are able to distinguish true walking signals from a wide range of non-walking movements with low uncertainty. The proposed algorithm effectively distinguishes normal walking from such anomalies and achieves a high detection rate of 95.2% ± 0.7% for normal movements in a 40 km long dataset recorded from eight people using a smartphone in texting, pocket, and swing mode. The algorithm detects anomalous movements with a detection rate of 82.5% ± 1.25% and thus successfully filters out these false signals. Furthermore, the suitability of the algorithm for mobile devices is emphasized by evaluating its computational and energy efficiency using metrics such as floating point operations per second (FLOPs), CPU processing time and energy consumption.
